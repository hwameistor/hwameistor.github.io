As more and more stateful applications are moved onto container platforms, stateful applications have become a major consumer of storage. As a cornerstone for running applications, storage now becomes a major challenge in the process of containerization. In the era of cloud native, what are the new requirements for storage systems? What are the new opportunities and challenges facing cloud-native storage? What are the popular cloud native storage solutions?</p><p>On June 20th, 2022, we had a live discussion with <a href="https://www.pengyunnetwork.cn/#/Main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pengyun Network</a> on three topics: cloud-native local storage, cloud-native storage solutions for Kubernetes, and the storage systems needed in the era of cloud native.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hwameistor">HwameiStor<a class="hash-link" href="#hwameistor" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As an infrastructure for containerization in cloud native stack, cloud-native storage exposes underlying storage services to containers and micro-services, and collects storage resources from different media. It can enable stateful workloads to run in containers by providing persistent volumes. CNCF's definition for cloud-native storage has three key points. First, it runs on Kubernetes as a container. Second, it uses Kubernetes object classes, mainly custom resource definition (CRD). Last and the most important, it uses a container storage interface (CSI). HwameiStor is developed based on these three points. it is an end-to-end cloud-native local storage system.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="HwameiStor Architecture" src="/assets/images/hwameistor-architecture-8e6610b9d4887978e12794b35da3701d.png" width="1373" height="535" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The bottom layer of HwameiStor is a local disk manager (LDM). LDM automatically collects resources from various storage media (such as HDD, SSD and NVMe disks) to form a local storage resource pool for unified automatic management. After HwameiStor is deployed, it can allocate resources on various storage media to different pools. Above the resource pool, it uses logical volume manager (LVM) for management, It also uses the CSI architecture to provide distributed local data volume service, so as to provide data persistence capabilities for cloud-native stateful applications or components.</p><p>HwameiStor is a storage system designed for cloud native. It supports high availability, automation, rapid deployment, and high performance with low cost, making it a good alternative to expensive traditional storage area network (SAN). It has three core components:</p><ul><li><p>Local Disk Management (LDM), which uses CRD to define and manage local data disks. LDM can explicitly get the attributes, size and other information of local disks in Kubernetes.</p></li><li><p>Local Storage (LS), which uses LVM to allocate logical volumes (LV) to persistent volumes (PV) after LDM is implemented.</p></li><li><p>Scheduler, which schedules containers to nodes with local data.</p></li></ul><p>The core of HwameiStor lies in the definition and implementation of CRDs. On top of  PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) object classes in Kubernetes, HwameiStor defines a new object class that can associate PV/PVC in Kubernetes with local data disks.</p><p>HwameiStor has four features：</p><ul><li><p>Automatic operation and management: it can automatically discover, identify, manage, and allocate disks, and schedule applications and data according to affinity. It can also automatically monitor disk status and provide timely warning.</p></li><li><p>Highly available data support: HwameiStor uses cross-node replicas to synchronize data and achieve high availability. When a node goes wrong, it will automatically schedule applications to highly available data nodes to ensure application continuity.</p></li><li><p>Rich types of data volume: HwameiStor aggregates HDD, SSD, and NVMe disks to provide data services with low latency and high throughput.</p></li><li><p>Flexible and dynamic linear expansion：HwameiStor can dynamically expand according to cluster size to meet application's requirements for data persistence.</p></li></ul><p>HwameiStor is recommended in the following scenarios:</p><ul><li><p>Adapt to middlewares with a highly available architecture</p><p>Some middlewares, like Kafka, ElasticSearch and Redis, have a highly available architecture and a high requirement for IO data access. The LVM-based single-replica local data volumes provided by HwameiStor are suitable for such kind of applications.</p></li><li><p>Provide highly available data volumes for applications</p><p>MySQL and other OLTP databases require their underlying storage systems to provide highly available data storage for quick recovery. Meanwhile, data access should also have a high performance. The highly available dual-replica data volumes with can meet these requirements.</p></li><li><p>Provide automatic operation and maintenance for traditional storage software</p><p>MinIO, Ceph and other similar storage software need to use the disks on Kubernetes nodes. HwameiStor's single-replica local volumes can fast respond to the business system's needs for deployment, expansion, and migration, thus realizing automatic operation and maintenance based on Kubernetes. This kind of local volumes can be automatically used by PVC/PV through CSI drives.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zettastor-hasp">ZettaStor HASP<a class="hash-link" href="#zettastor-hasp" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>According to the CNCF 2020 Annual Report, stateful applications account for 55% of all container applications, making it a mainstream. About 29% stateful applications listed storage as the main challenge for adopting container technology. A storage problem facing cloud native scenarios is that it is difficult to balance performance and availability. Using a single type of storage cannot meet all needs. Therefore, in the actual implementation of stateful applications, data storage technology is the key.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Storage Solution Comparison" src="/assets/images/compare-storage-037fad93660b36b9dae3aac41588abed.png" width="1080" height="342" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>ZettaStor HASP is a cloud-native data aggregation &amp; storage platform. It is also a user-state file system of high performance that supports redundancy protection based on multiple replicas across heterogeneous storage systems. Data replicas can flow between different types of storage systems, which is a big competitiveness over traditional distributed storage systems. In addition, it also supports unified and flexible orchestration of storage resources, and can be tightly integrated with container platforms.</p><p>For example:</p><p>ZettaStor HASP has a higher data access performance and can realize dynamic allocation and refined management of storage resources. This is desirable for distributed applications that have data redundancy mechanisms themselves and also require high performance, such as Kafka, Redis, MongoDB, and HDFS.</p><p>ZettaStor HASP can achieve data high availability based on cross-node redundancy protection, and meanwhile ensure high performance of local storage. This is suitable for applications that have no data redundancy mechanisms and must rely on external storage, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL.</p><ul><li>Critical business should prevent the risk of simultaneous failure of two nodes. ZettaStor HASP's replica redundancy protection across local and external storage systems can ensure smooth running of critical business.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ZettaStor HASP Architecture" src="/assets/images/zettastor-efca08b8ca7386a2fc071b9f13747857.png" width="1080" height="601" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>ZettaStor HASP has a three-layer architecture. On the top is a high-performance distributed file system, which is also the core of HASP. This independently-developed file system is fully compatible with POSIX standards and supports zero data copy between user-mode and kernel-mode, giving a full play to the performance of high-speed media, such as NVMe SSD/SCM/PM. In the middle is the data service layer, which can provide services across local storage systems on different nodes, across local storage and external storage systems, and across heterogeneous external storage systems. It can be customized into single replica, multiple replicas, strong consistency, and weak consistency solutions. At the bottom is a storage management layer, which is responsible for interacting with different storage devices. It can break device barriers and connect data islands with unified data format, helping data and business get rid of device limitations. In addition, it can also schedule storage devices through CSI.</p><p>ZettaStor HASP is a distributed storage platform closely integrated with container platforms. It supports hyper-converged deployment and CSI integration. It has node affinity, and can sense the running status of user's pods, making storage behavior more adaptable.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="round-table-discussion">Round Table Discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#round-table-discussion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Q1: What is cloud-native storage</p><p><a href="https://github.com/alexzhc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alexzhc</a>: In a narrow sense, cloud-native storage need meet three standards. First, it should meet CSI specification and connect well with CS. Second, it should be deployed on Kubernetes as a container. Third, information in the storage system should create a new object class through CRDs and eventually be stored in Kubernetes.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/fengqinah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fengqinah</a>: Cloud-native storage has multiple features and can meet various demands. In addition to providing a unified storage platform that can offer different storage features for different applications, it should also connect CSI and establish a bridge between storage systems and Kubernetes for communication.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/niulechuan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">niulechuan</a>：The most common cloud-native storage solutions are based on cloud storage or distributed storage. Meanwhile, some service providers are also trying to extend the special capabilities of traditional storage.</p><p>Q2: How should cloud-native storage support cloud-native applications</p><p><a href="https://github.com/fengqinah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fengqinah</a>: There are mainly two points. First, cloud-native storage should support features of cloud-native applications, because these features decide the application's requirements for storage. Second, it should meet CSI specifications to support special cloud native requirements.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/niulechuan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">niulechuan</a>: From a performance perspective, cloud-native storage needs to meet all requirements of the CSI architecture, so that it can fit diverse cloud-native scenarios. In order to provide good underlying support and response guarantee for cloud-native applications, cloud-native storage needs efficient operation and maintenance. In real cases, cost, portability, and technical support should also be taken into consideration when designing a cloud-native storage solution. Like cloud-native applications, cloud-native storage also requires "elasticity". It should have elastic computing capabilities, scalable data, conversions between cold and hot data. In addition, cloud-native storage should also have an open ecosystem.</p><p>Q3: What are the similarities and differences between cloud-native storage and traditional storage? How about their advantages and disadvantages</p><p><a href="https://github.com/alexzhc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alexzhc</a>：Cloud-native storage is aggregated with Kubernetes after being deployed, while traditional storage is often separated from Kubernetes after being deployed. Cloud-native storage runs on Kubernetes, making it convenient to develop micro-services. If using traditional storage, developers might need to extend the storage API. However, the aggregated form may also, to a certain extent, cause the problem of Kubernetes easily spill over to storage, bringing difficulties to operation and maintenance. Besides, cloud-native storage also has problems about network sharing and disk load.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/fengqinah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fengqinah</a>：In external storage, storage nodes and computing nodes have a weak mutual impact. Back-end storage is generally distributed, with relatively high security and availability. However, in cloud native scenarios, only using external storage has certain disadvantages. It will increase network consumption, generate additional cost, and lack linkage with Kubernetes.</p><p>Q4: How should cloud-native storage empower traditional storage</p><p><a href="https://github.com/niulechuan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">niulechuan</a>：This is a very urgent need. Kubernetes-native capabilities, such as deletion, creation, and expansion, are mainly implemented through CRDs. The community plays an active role in this process. At the same time, some capabilities of traditional storage have not yet been realized in cloud-native storage, such as cron jobs and observability. How to make cloud-native storage better empower traditional storage on platforms, give full play to their advantages, and further advance cloud native storage? This is a long way to go, and our team is working on this.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/alexzhc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alexzhc</a>: To add one more thing. To use a common way to connect Kubernetes and traditional storage, you should aggregate CSI drivers. However, although CSI defines some storage operation flows, it is an interface after all. Therefore, we should consider whether the CSI community should use CRDs to define some features of traditional storage, and whether service providers can define some high-level and special flows by CRDs? We should try to make Kubernetes more applicable in the storage field.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This test environment is Kubernetes 1.22. We deployed TiDB 1.3 after the HwameiStor local storage is attached. Then, we performed the basic SQL capability test, system security test, and operation and maintenance management test.</p><p>All the tests passed successfully, it is acknowledged that HwameiStor can support distributed database application scenarios such as TiDB with high availability, strong consistency requirements, and large data scale.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction-to-tidb">Introduction to TiDB<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction-to-tidb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>TiDB is a distributed database product that supports OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing) services, compatible with key features such as MySQL 5.7 protocol and MySQL ecosystem. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with one-stop OLTP, OLAP, and HTAP solutions, which are suitable for various application scenarios such as high availability, strict requirements for strong consistency, and large data scale.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tidb-architecture">TiDB architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#tidb-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The TiDB distributed database splits the overall architecture into multiple modules that can communicate with each other. The architecture diagram is as follows:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TiDB architecture" src="/assets/images/architecture-2a3f12e542dfbb4545e4e20e4da92010.png" width="1046" height="500" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><p><strong>TiDB Server</strong></p><p>The SQL layer exposes the connection endpoints of the MySQL protocol to the outside world, and is responsible for accepting connections from clients, performing SQL parsing and optimization and finally generating a distributed execution plan. The TiDB layer itself is stateless. In practice, you can start several TiDB instances. A unified access address is provided externally through load-balance components (such as LVS, HAProxy, or F5), and client connections can be evenly distributed on to these TiDB instances. The TiDB server itself does not store data, but only parses SQL and forwards the actual data read request to the underlying storage node, TiKV (or TiFlash).</p></li><li><p><strong>PD (Placement Driver) Server</strong></p><p>The metadata management module across a TiDB cluster is responsible for storing the real-time data distribution of each TiKV node and the overall topology of the cluster, providing the TiDB Dashboard management and control interface, and assigning transaction IDs to distributed transactions. Placement Driver (PD) not only stores metadata, but also issues data scheduling commands to specific TiKV nodes based on the real-time data distribution status reported by TiKV nodes, which can be said to be the "brain" of the entire cluster. In addition, the PD itself is also composed of at least 3 nodes and has high availability capabilities. It is recommended to deploy an odd number of PD nodes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage nodes</strong></p><ul><li><p>TiKV Server: In charge of storing data. From the outside, TiKV is a distributed Key-Value storage engine that provides transactions. The basic unit for storing data is Region. Each Region is responsible for storing the data of a Key Range (the block between left-closed and right-open from StartKey to EndKey). Each TiKV node is responsible for multiple Regions. TiKV API provides native support for distributed transactions at the KV key-value pair level, and provides the levels of Snapshot Isolation (SI) by default, which is also the core of TiDB's support for distributed transactions at the SQL level. After the SQL layer of TiDB completes the SQL parsing, it will convert the SQL execution plan into the actual call to the TiKV API. Therefore, the data is stored in TiKV. In addition, the TiKV data will be automatically maintained in multiple replicas (the default is three replicas), which naturally supports high availability and automatic failover.</p></li><li><p>TiFlash is a special storage node. Unlike ordinary TiKV nodes, data is stored in columns in TiFlash, and the main function is to accelerate analysis-based scenarios.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tidb-database-storage">TiDB database storage<a class="hash-link" href="#tidb-database-storage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TiDB database storage" src="/assets/images/storage-a293b3e63ad176d606e42501e0048276.png" width="1923" height="1779" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Key-Value Pair</strong></p><p>The choice of TiKV is the Key-Value model that provides an ordered traversal method. Two key points of TiKV data storage are:</p><ul><li><p>A huge Map (comparable to std::map in C++) that stores Key-Value Pairs.</p></li><li><p>The Key-Value pairs in this Map are sorted by the binary order of the Key, that is, you can seek to the position of a certain Key, and then continuously call the Next method to obtain the Key-Value larger than this Key in an ascending order.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Local storage (Rocks DB)</strong></p><p>In any persistent storage engine, data must be saved on disk after all, and TiKV is not different. However, TiKV does not choose to write data directly to the disk, but stores the data in RocksDB, and RocksDB is responsible for the specific data storage. The reason is that developing a stand-alone storage engine requires a lot of work, especially to make a high-performance stand-alone engine, which may require various meticulous optimizations. RocksDB is a very good stand-alone KV storage engine open sourced by Facebook. It can meet various requirements of TiKV for single engine. Here we can simply consider that RocksDB is a persistent Key-Value Map on a host.</p></li><li><p><strong>Raft protocol</strong></p><p>TiKV uses the Raft algorithm to ensure that data is not lost and error-free when a single host fails. In short, it is to replicate data to multiple hosts, so that if one host cannot provide services, replicas on other hosts can still provide services. This data replication scheme is reliable and efficient, and can deal with replica failures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Region</strong></p><p>TiKV divides the Range by Key. A certain segment of consecutive Keys are stored on a storage node. Divide the entire Key-Value space into many segments, each segment is a series of consecutive Keys, called a Region. Try to keep the data saved in each Region within a reasonable size. Currently, the default in TiKV is no more than 96 MB. Each Region can be described by a left-closed and right-open block such as <!-- -->[StartKey, EndKey]<!-- -->.</p></li><li><p><strong>MVCC</strong></p><p>TiKV implements Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC).</p></li><li><p><strong>Distributed ACID transactions</strong></p><p>TiKV uses the transaction model used by Google in BigTable: Percolator.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build-the-test-environment">Build the test environment<a class="hash-link" href="#build-the-test-environment" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kubernetes-cluster">Kubernetes cluster<a class="hash-link" href="#kubernetes-cluster" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In this test, we use three VM nodes to deploy the Kubernetes cluster, including one master node and two worker nodes.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>News today: The HwameiStor Reliable Helper System, an automatic and reliable cloud-native local storage maintenance system dedicated to system operation and maintenance, has been launched.</p></blockquote><p>DaoCloud officially opens source of HwameiStor Reliable Helper System, a cloud native, automatic, reliable local storage maintenance system. This system is still in the alpha stage. HwameiStor creates a local storage pool with HDD, SSD, and NVMe disks for a central management.

HwameiStor creates a local storage resource pool for centrally managing all disks such as HDD, SSD, and NVMe. It uses the CSI architecture to provide distributed services with local volumes, and provides data persistence capabilities for stateful cloud-native workloads or components.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="System architecture" src="/assets/images/architect-5b800d6ed2893aea97ee9b52dd53a1a2.jpg" width="1080" height="423" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the cloud native era, application developers can focus on the business logic itself, while the agility, scalability, and reliability required by the application runtime attribute to the infrastructure platform and O&amp;M team. <strong>Hwameistor is a storage system that grows in the cloud native era. </strong>It has the advantages of high availability, automation, cost-efficiency, rapid deployment, and high performance. It can replace the expensive traditional SAN storage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-local-storage-is-smart-stable-and-agile">The local storage is smart, stable, and agile<a class="hash-link" href="#the-local-storage-is-smart-stable-and-agile" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Automatic operation and maintenance management</p><p>Automatically discover, identify, manage, and allocate disks.
